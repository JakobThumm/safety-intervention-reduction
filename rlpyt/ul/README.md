Code accompanying the research paper "Decoupling Representation Learning from Reinforcement Learning" (arxiv link pending).

See "experiments" folder for scripts to run online RL agents with ATC, offline encoder training using a number of different UL algorithms, RL agents to evaluate pre-trained encoders, and other RL agents to gather expert demonstrations.

More detailed usage notes to come, eventually...
